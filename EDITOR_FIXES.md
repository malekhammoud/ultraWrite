# Editor Fixes & Improvements üõ†Ô∏è

## Issues Fixed

### ‚úÖ **Text Selection & Highlighting**
**Problem**: Couldn't select/highlight text in the editor.

**Fix**:
- Added explicit `user-select: text` CSS properties to all editor elements
- Fixed selection background color with proper opacity (purple with 40% opacity)
- Added both `::selection` and `::-moz-selection` for cross-browser support
- Ensured selection styling works on both the editor and nested elements

**Result**: Text can now be selected perfectly with a beautiful purple highlight.

---

### ‚úÖ **Disappearing Text Issue**
**Problem**: Text would sometimes disappear when typing or formatting.

**Root Cause**: Two separate editor instances were being created (one in `EditorPane` and one in `TiptapEditor`), causing conflicts.

**Fix**:
- Removed the duplicate `TiptapEditor.tsx` component
- Consolidated to a single editor instance in `EditorPane.tsx`
- Added proper content synchronization with change detection
- Implemented `min-height` on paragraphs to prevent collapse
- Added `white-space: pre-wrap` to ensure proper text rendering

**Result**: Text stays visible at all times and renders correctly.

### ‚úÖ **Editor Stability & Performance**
**Problem**: Editor was laggy, had cursor jumps, and unstable behavior.

**Fixes**:
1. **Prevented Unnecessary Re-renders**:
   - Added content comparison in `updateContent()` store method
   - Only updates when content actually changes
   - Simplified dependencies in hooks

2. **Fixed Cursor Jumping**:
   - Use `setContent(content, false)` to preserve cursor position
   - Compare stringified JSON before updating
   - Removed redundant state updates

3. **Improved Autosave**:
   - Increased delay from 1s to 2s to reduce flickering
   - Added content comparison to skip unchanged saves
   - Added visual feedback delay (300ms) for better UX
   - Uses ref to track last saved content

4. **Enhanced History**:
   - Configured history depth to 100 actions
   - Added disabled states for undo/redo buttons
   - Buttons properly reflect when actions are available
