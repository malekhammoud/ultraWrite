# Evaluate Mode - Fixed!

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Submission Now Works
**Before:** Evaluate mode only created rubrics, couldn't submit for AI feedback
**After:** Clicking "Apply" or "Evaluate" now sends the text to AI and shows results

### 2. ✅ No Selection Required
**Before:** Required text selection to use evaluate mode
**After:** Works with or without selection:
- **With selection**: Evaluates selected text only
- **Without selection**: Automatically evaluates the entire document

### 3. ✅ Feedback Display
**Before:** No way to see evaluation results
**After:** Results shown in formatted alert dialog with:
- Score (if provided)
- Strengths
- Weaknesses
- Suggestions for improvement

## How It Works Now

### Evaluation Flow

1. **Open Evaluate Mode**
   - Select "Evaluate" from AI toolbar
   - Sidebar opens

2. **Create or Select Rubric**
   - Use existing saved rubric, OR
   - Create new rubric with custom criteria

3. **Optional: Select Text**
   - Select specific text to evaluate, OR
   - Leave no selection to evaluate entire document

4. **Submit**
   - Click "Apply", "Evaluate", or "Create & Evaluate"
   - AI processes the text against your rubric

5. **View Results**
   - Results appear in alert popup
   - Formatted with score, strengths, weaknesses, suggestions

### Changes Made

#### 1. `handleSubmit()` Function
```typescript
// Now handles no selection case
const hasSelection = from !== to;
const textToProcess = hasSelection && selectedText
  ? selectedText.text
  : editor.getText(); // Use full document if no selection

const actualFrom = hasSelection ? from : 0;
const actualTo = hasSelection ? to : editor.state.doc.content.size;
```

#### 2. Evaluate Mode Logic
```typescript
} else if (currentMode === 'evaluate') {
  const request: AIFeedbackRequest = {
    documentId: currentDocument.id,
    userId: 'default-user',
    selectedText: textToProcess, // Now uses full doc if needed
    context: selectedText?.context,
    feedbackType: 'evaluate',
    fullDocument: JSON.stringify(currentDocument.content),
    customInstruction: instructionToUse,
  };

  const response = await aiApi.getFeedback(request);

  // Display feedback in alert
  if (response.feedback || response.evaluation) {
    const feedbackText = response.feedback ||
      (response.evaluation ? formatEvaluation(response.evaluation) : '');

    if (feedbackText) {
      alert(`Evaluation Results:\n\n${feedbackText}`);
    }
  }

  // Don't create suggestions - just show feedback
  suggestions = [];
}
```

#### 3. New Helper Function
```typescript
function formatEvaluation(evaluation: any): string {
  const parts = [];

  if (evaluation.score !== undefined) {
    parts.push(`Score: ${evaluation.score}/100`);
  }

  if (evaluation.strengths && evaluation.strengths.length > 0) {
    parts.push('\nStrengths:');
    evaluation.strengths.forEach((s: string) => parts.push(`• ${s}`));
  }

  if (evaluation.weaknesses && evaluation.weaknesses.length > 0) {
    parts.push('\nWeaknesses:');
    evaluation.weaknesses.forEach((w: string) => parts.push(`• ${w}`));
  }

  if (evaluation.suggestions && evaluation.suggestions.length > 0) {
    parts.push('\nSuggestions:');
    evaluation.suggestions.forEach((s: string) => parts.push(`• ${s}`));
  }

  return parts.join('\n');
}
```

#### 4. UI Updates
```typescript
// Header shows appropriate message
<p className="text-xs text-white/70">
  {hasSelection
    ? `${selectedText.text.length} chars selected`
    : currentMode === 'evaluate'
    ? 'Evaluating full document'
    : 'No selection - will use full document'}
</p>

// Submit button shows for evaluate even without selection
{(hasSelection || currentMode === 'evaluate') && (
  <motion.button onClick={handleSubmit}>
    // ...
  </motion.button>
)}

// Content area always shows (no "select text first" message)
<div className="flex-1 overflow-y-auto p-4">
  <div className="space-y-4">
    {/* Rubric UI */}
  </div>
</div>
```

## All Modes Now Support Full Document

The fix also applied to other modes:
- **Agent Mode**: Works on full document if no selection
- **Rewrite Mode**: Can rewrite entire document
- **Expand Mode**: Can expand full document

## Example Rubrics

### Essay Evaluation
```
Clarity: Is the writing clear and easy to understand?
Evidence: Are claims supported with evidence?
Structure: Is the text well-organized?
Grammar: Is the writing free of grammatical errors?
```

### Technical Writing
```
Accuracy: Are technical details correct?
Completeness: Does it cover all necessary information?
Clarity: Is it easy to follow for the target audience?
Examples: Are there sufficient examples?
```

### Creative Writing
```
Engagement: Does it capture and hold attention?
Character Development: Are characters well-developed?
Pacing: Is the pacing appropriate?
Dialogue: Is dialogue natural and effective?
```

## API Response Format

The backend should return either:

### Simple Feedback
```json
{
  "feedback": "Overall, the writing is clear and well-structured. Consider adding more evidence to support claims in paragraph 2..."
}
```

### Structured Evaluation
```json
{
  "evaluation": {
    "score": 85,
    "strengths": [
      "Clear thesis statement",
      "Good use of examples",
      "Strong conclusion"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Some paragraphs lack transitions",
      "Limited evidence in section 2"
    ],
    "suggestions": [
      "Add transitional phrases between paragraphs",
      "Include more citations in second section",
      "Consider restructuring paragraph 3 for better flow"
    ]
  }
}
```

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for evaluate mode:

   - Syntax highlighting
   - Copy to clipboard button
   - Export as PDF/markdown

2. **Inline Annotations**
   - Highlight specific issues in text
   - Click to see detailed feedback
   - Suggested changes

3. **Comparison View**
   - Before/after comparison
   - Show improvements over time
   - Track scores across evaluations

4. **Rubric Library**
   - Import/export rubrics
   - Share rubrics with team
   - Pre-built templates

5. **Historical Tracking**

## Conclusion

Evaluate mode is now fully functional! Users can:
- Create and save custom rubrics
- Evaluate selected text or entire document
- Receive formatted AI feedback
- Reuse rubrics for consistent evaluation

The changes also improved all other AI modes by adding full-document support when no text is selected.
