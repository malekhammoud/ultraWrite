# UltraWrite v2.0 - New AI-First Interface

## What's New

We've completely redesigned the frontend to create the **best AI writing experience ever** - combining the inline suggestions of Grammarly, the command palette of Cursor, and the conversational AI of GitHub Copilot.

---

## üéØ Major Changes

### 1. **Bottom AI Toolbar** (Like Cursor/Copilot)
- Fixed toolbar at the bottom of the screen
- Always accessible, never in the way
- Keyboard shortcut: `Cmd/Ctrl + K`
- Clean, minimal design that scales with your workflow

### 2. **AI Mode Dropdown**
Choose from 4 powerful AI modes:

#### üü¢ **Fix Grammar**
- Instant grammar, spelling, and punctuation checks
- Shows each error as a diff with red (removed) and green (added)
- Accept or reject each suggestion individually

#### üü£ **Rewrite**
- Generate alternative versions of your text
- See multiple rewrite options
- Perfect for improving tone or style

#### üîµ **Expand**
- Elaborate on your ideas with AI-generated content
- Add details, examples, and context
- Shows additions in green

#### üü° **Agent Mode** (NEW!)
- **Like Cursor AI for writing**
- Give custom instructions: "Make this more formal", "Add statistics", etc.
- Conversational interface with history
- The AI remembers your previous requests
- Perfect for complex edits

### 3. **Inline Diff View** (Like GitHub/VSCode)
- **Red background** = Text being removed
- **Green background** = Text being added
- **Strike-through** for deletions
- Individual accept/reject buttons on hover
- Or accept/reject all at once

### 4. **Agent Input Modal**
- Beautiful modal for Agent Mode instructions
- Quick suggestions: "Make it more concise", "Add more details", etc.
- Keyboard shortcut: `Cmd/Ctrl + Enter` to send
- Context-aware: sees your conversation history

### 5. **Word Count in Toolbar**
- Moved word/character count to top toolbar
- Always visible, never distracting
- Real-time updates as you type

---

## üé® Design Improvements

### Before
- Tabs (Feedback, Rewrite, Expand) in a right sidebar
- Apply/Dismiss buttons didn't work
- No visual diff highlighting
- Cluttered interface

### After
- Clean dropdown selector at the bottom
- Working Apply/Reject buttons
- Red/green diff visualization (like code editors)
- Minimal, focused interface
- More screen space for writing

---

## üöÄ How to Use

### Quick Start
1. **Select text** in the editor
2. Press `Cmd/Ctrl + K` or click the AI toolbar at the bottom
3. **Choose a mode**:
   - Grammar: Instant fixes
   - Rewrite: Alternative versions
   - Expand: Add more detail
   - Agent: Custom instructions
4. **Review the diff** (red = removed, green = added)
5. **Accept or reject** changes

### Agent Mode Example
```
1. Select: "AI is transforming industries."

2. Agent instruction: "Make this more detailed and add specific examples"

3. AI suggests (in green):
   "AI is transforming industries across healthcare, finance, and
   transportation. For example, ML models are now detecting diseases
   earlier than human doctors, while autonomous vehicles are reducing
   traffic accidents by 40%."

4. Accept or edit further!
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### New Components

```
frontend/src/components/AIToolbar/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ AIToolbar.tsx          # Main bottom toolbar
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ AIModeSelector.tsx     # Mode dropdown (Grammar/Rewrite/Expand/Agent)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ DiffView.tsx           # Red/green diff visualization
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ AgentInput.tsx         # Modal for Agent Mode instructions

frontend/src/lib/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ editorHelpers.ts       # Apply diffs to TipTap editor

frontend/src/contexts/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ EditorContext.tsx      # Share editor instance
```

### Removed Components
- ‚ùå `AIFeedbackPanel.tsx` (old tab-based sidebar)

## üîß Technical Details

### Diff Visualization
Each change is rendered with:
- `type: 'add' | 'remove' | 'unchanged'`
- Color coding (green-500/red-500)
- Border indicators
- Hover tooltips for individual actions

### Apply Changes
Uses `applyDiffChanges()` to:
1. Find the original text in the TipTap document
2. Replace it with the new version
3. Preserve cursor position
4. Handle edge cases (no selection, etc.)

### Agent Mode Conversation
- Stores full conversation history in Zustand
- Sends context to backend for better suggestions
- Shows explanations for each edit
- Maintains state across multiple requests

---

## üéØ What Makes This Special

1. **Best of all worlds**:
   - Grammarly's inline suggestions
   - Cursor's command palette UX
   - GitHub Copilot's conversational AI

2. **Granular control**:
   - Accept/reject individual changes
   - Or batch accept/reject all
   - Visual diff makes it obvious what's changing

3. **Agent Mode is a game-changer**:
   - No more rigid "fix grammar" or "rewrite"
   - Tell the AI exactly what you want
   - Iterative refinement with conversation history

4. **Clean, focused interface**:
   - More writing space
   - AI tools when you need them
   - Not cluttering your view when you don't

## üé® UI/UX Philosophy

> "The best AI writing tool gets out of your way until you need it, then gives you superpowers."

**Design principles:**
1. **Bottom toolbar**: Always accessible, never blocking
2. **Diff view**: Visual, intuitive, like code editors
3. **Agent Mode**: Conversational, contextual, powerful
4. **Keyboard-first**: Everything is 1-2 keys away
5. **Minimal chrome**: Maximum space for writing

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

Ideas for v2.1+:
- [ ] Ghost text preview (like Copilot)
- [ ] Streaming AI responses with real-time diff
- [ ] Multiple rewrite options side-by-side
- [ ] Undo/redo for AI changes
- [ ] AI suggestion history
- [ ] Custom AI modes (saved prompts)
- [ ] Collaborative editing with AI suggestions

---

## üìä Performance

- **Diff rendering**: O(n) with memoization
- **Editor updates**: Debounced to prevent lag
- **Modal animations**: 60 FPS with Framer Motion
- **API calls**: Only when user requests (no auto-polling)
